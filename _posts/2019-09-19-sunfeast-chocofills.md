Tried this at 2:42 am, due to rather ordinary circumstances. However I guess the mental state of the cookie eater must be noted at all points before a review is conducted. My own mental state was rather pleasant, rather fixated on serious things before breaking off for the night. I had last eaten around 5 hours before the time of cookie tasting, and at this point I'm craving some good breakfast, with cold milk and warm toast that's crunchy and brittle, the sort that melts in your mouth, dropping in butter that's just perfectly melted. On expressing myself rather plainly (ugh I want breakfast) I was offered this cookie as compensation. This log is just to appreciate how a choco-fill cookie is quite a good tool of mood upliftment and generally a good option to pacify hunger pangs and frustration.

The outer shell of coarse cookie barely gave any resistance to the bite. Overall a very docile cookie, seems to like to keep things simple (unlike other samples like rusk, that would usually put up a good fight till the last bite). Wouldn't call it bite sized, but maybe a 3 bite size with a friendly circular shape with a bulge on one side giving it an attractive yet rather unimaginative appearance. Couldn't help but notice the void in the centre filled with chocolate that I expected would drip out but it seemed to have become semi solid. A rather simple, no bullshit experience. Would've loved to try this with cold milk/ a banana. Still, I would conclude by saying it's not the best substitute for breakfast, but a great gobble friendly cookie to keep you going.
