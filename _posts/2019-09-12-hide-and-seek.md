Today the panel consists of Muddassir, Archit and me. This is our collective experience:

![Unibic's Choco Hazelnut cookies](https://cookies.wtf/assets/hide-and-seek.jpeg) 

This packet has been open for 1.5 days and stored in a pseudo leather bag, tied with a knot. The first biscuit was broken. A bit soft because of exposure to air. It's a bit sticky and powdery, also crumbly. First biscuit was chip heavy which is perfect. Overall top notch but it got over too soon. But it's ok because there were many more. Muddassir particularly enjoyed the 5th one. That's all folks.
