hey guys, so today I tried Britannia's TREAT JIMJAM (naughty jelly)

Due to personal reasons I like to eat cookies only with a banana (usually taken in advance from the mess in the morning, chosen according to the colour, quality, bruises and peers) and today was no exception.

#### Number of biscuits for a banana
3-4

The biscuit was good, soft enough to break easily and crumble between your teeth, later dissolving in your mouth but hard enough to maintain the structure still, I found the biscuit to be a little thick but it wasn't too distracting since the texture was a great balance. The cookie to cream to jelly ratio was about 5:2:1, the cream was overly sweet and grainy but it was being balanced by the biscuit's neutral nature, The cream on its own tasted like diabetes in its truest form. Moreover, the biscuit as a whole was structurally sound since the jam (which seeped into all three layers) kept it intact, I fount the cream distribution to be a little uneven, making the biscuit wobbly.

The jam was VERY sweet and naughty, the consistency was too thick, I could feel the jelly sticking to my teeth due to it. The jelly had sugar sprinkled on the top which I'm not sure if it was required because the entire biscuit was already a little sugar high but having said that, since the jelly was different kind of sweet (mixed with a tad bit of sourness, enough to activate your salivary glands), I guess it made sense to make that decision.

Please don't try to find Jim inside these Jimjams, I was very disappointed after I realised that putting a JIM in their name was just an advertisment tactic. 

#### Overall rating
7.8/10

Fully recommend eating it while watching an old PPG/Dexter episode.
