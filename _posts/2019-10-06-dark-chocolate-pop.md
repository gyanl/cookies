Eaten at 2:56am while watching Disenchantment s2.

### Pros:
- It looks very visually appealing because the red velvet has radial gradation from light to dark

- Good mix of textures : red velvet with smooth ice-cream

- Near-perfectly round

- Costs about 150R so not bad.

- Is not to small, so it doesn't get over too soon.

- Has cool Dry-ice packaging that you can play with all night long if you are sad and/or alone

- Smiley Pops is open till super late so medium-good quality snax available when you actually need them

### Cons:
- Can sometimes feel slightly sweeter than required (but only intermittently)

### Overall rating:

#### 7/8
for yum visuals

#### 6/8
for yum mouthfeel

#### 8/8
for fun packaging
