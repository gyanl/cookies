11 cubes consumed so far

Eaten with kimchi noodles, as a neutralizer for the spice while watching Mindhunter S02. Season 2 is even better than season 1 and I would highly recommend it. The sound design and cinematography are on-point. The show is a minimum of 3 steps ahead of you at any given time. If you've watched True detective season 1 and loved it, this is the show for you. R8 8/8.

The wafer cubes were tastless at first but as the layered cream came through it turned medium hazelnutty bitter-sweet. Much better than the biscuits/cookies I've reviewed so far. 6.5/8 for toning down the sugar and letting an original flavour take the limelight.

#### PS: 
Try to ration these because they're deceptively light, so you might end up eating too many. 

#### PPS:
Mindhunter demonstrates the methodology for contextual enquiry and interviewing techniques covered in ixD user studies module 1.
