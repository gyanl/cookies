Presenting my review on these cheapskate biscuits. They only cost 20 Rs, which is roughly 2 Rs per biscuit. Hella cheap. Taste is decent, a little sweet, but what more can I ask for 2 Rs. Cream doesnâ€™t taste like real cream, tastes like some vegetable oil mess. The biscuit is fine. Tastes like any other biscuit. The milky taste takes it away. 

I would rate it:

#### Taste 
6/10

#### Affordability
9/10 

The smiles also look creepy sometimes, they need to hire better designers.

Also sometimes, you get biscuits like these... yeah no. No aesthetics yikes
