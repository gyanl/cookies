Hi, so today I had Unibic's Choco Hazelnut cookies out of sheer boredom and one extra banana I had lying around. I can't tell much about the how it tasted (because I have cold and hence my tastebuds aren't working) but what stood out the most was the texture and crunchiness. It almost felt like I'm eating a Bisleri plastic bottle (in a good way).

The cookie holds its structure, rebels if you want to bite into it, doesn't give up till the very end, imagine hard sugar Prasad crystals. Imagine it being harder, yeah, now add plastic bottles and eat that.
