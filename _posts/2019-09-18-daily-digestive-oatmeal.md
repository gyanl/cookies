title: Unibic Daily Digestive Oatmeal cookies

Hi everyone, today I am reviewing Unibic Daily Digestive Oatmeal cookies along with Avyay. Avyay did not want a cookie, but provided significant moral support.

#### Rationale for purchase
The cookies claim to have 26% of your daily fibre requirement, and I bought them in the hope that it would improve my subsistence diet of bananas, vada pao and chai.

#### Value for money
The packet was 50 bucks, so it's not cheap, but I was unable to finish it in one shot like I usually do and I saved half the packet for the next day. So I'd say the initial investment is high but value for money is not terrible. 

#### Taste
They're good cookies, slightly sweet but not too sweet. The high fiber content means that it feels quite substantial for a cookie, and it's hard to binge these. There is a slight salty aftertaste sometimes just to mix things up. You might not initially enjoy it but it grows on you.

#### Effect on digestion
Unknown, will update when more information becomes available.
